Purpose of the project is to provide a user friendly and interactive visualization of world urban development over the past 5 decades. Based on the clientâ€™s data set, application aims to provide visual representations in the form of multiple graphs and map for given set of dimensions/parameters. Apart from the visual perspective, the application would reduce the human effort in filtering and normalizing the data and offer easy, flexible automated visualizations. Web application would allow the user to visualize urban development parameters of a single country or compare different countries growth rate for the given data. Application shall also provide options to change the graphic colors on demand, print them directly and save as images in multiple formats on a local machine..
